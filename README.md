# ðŸ“± Cell Simulation & Call Log Project

This project is a **simple Java-based simulation** designed for educational purposes.  
It models **cell state changes** over time and simulates **call log tracking**, with a very basic user interface for testing and visualization.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview
The goal of this project is to:
- Simulate **cell state transitions** step-by-step.
- Track and visualize **call logs** in a structured way.
- Provide **basic menu interfaces** for interacting with both simulations.

---

## ðŸ›  Features
- **Cell Simulation**:
  - Start from an initial cell state.
  - Advance through simulation steps.
  - Display changes visually.
- **Call Log Simulation**:
  - Record calls with time and status.
  - Display logs step-by-step.
- **Menu Navigation**:
  - Switch between simulation types.
  - View results for each scenario.
